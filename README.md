# Live-weather-Dashboard-With-Auto-Refresh-Using-Weather-API
I recently delivered a Live Weather Analytics Dashboard built entirely in Microsoft Power BI, featuring real-time API integration and a custom dark UI theme designed in Figma.  This project goes beyond static visuals â€” it brings data to life with dynamic updates as weather conditions change in real time.
Project Highlights:
âœ… Live Weather API Integration â€“ Fetching real-time temperature, humidity, wind speed, and air quality metrics.
âœ… Figma-Based Custom UI â€“ A dark, futuristic interface with smooth gradients, neon highlights, and IoT-inspired gauge visuals.
âœ… DAX-Powered Intelligence â€“ Calculated AQI levels (PM10, CO, SOâ‚‚, Oâ‚ƒ, NOâ‚‚, PM2.5) with live status text, color codes, and health insights.
âœ… Sunriseâ€“Sunset & Visibility Logic â€“ Custom measures to visualize day cycles and atmospheric clarity.
âœ… Dynamic Theme JSON â€“ Consistent typography, backgrounds, and iconography aligned with Figma design.

Tech Stack:

Microsoft Power BI (Data Modeling, DAX, API Integration)

Figma (Custom UI & Dashboard Design)

Live Weather API (JSON Feed)

ðŸŽ¯ This dashboard showcases how real-time analytics, smart DAX modeling, and creative UI/UX design can transform Power BI into a living, interactive experience.
